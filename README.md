# My First Blog - Next.js with Firebase

A simple and modern blog application built using **Next.js** and **Firebase Firestore**. This project leverages **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for optimized performance and fetches blog posts dynamically from Firestore.

## 🚀 Features

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Blog pages are pre-generated at build time for better performance and SEO.
- **Firebase Firestore Integration**: Posts are stored and fetched dynamically using Firebase SDK.
- **Skeleton Loader**: Displays a loading placeholder while fetching blog content.
- **Dynamic Routes**: Each blog post is rendered dynamically based on its unique ID in the URL.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash

### 3. Set Up Firebase

To connect your application to Firebase:

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new Firebase project (or use an existing one).
3. Enable **Firestore** in your Firebase project.
4. Get the Firebase configuration details from **Project Settings > General > Your Apps**.
5. Replace the Firebase config in `connection/firebaseConfig.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};
export default firebaseConfig;
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
